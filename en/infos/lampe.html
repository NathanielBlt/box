              <h1>School’s over!</h1>

              <h2>At university, everything is bigger, but we’ll explain everything!</h2></div>

      <div class="content">

    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />At the head of the university, there isn’t a headmaster or headmistress like at school, but a president. The current president is <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/actualites/detail-actualite/?tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=591&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;cHash=49e15fddd687012d415bbfc510d7f3eb"><span>Jean-Christophe Camart</span></a>.</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Deputy headmasters or headmistresses are replaced by a number of vice-presidents or “VPs” <span>in each field</span> (research, training, culture, etc.). They are members of the teaching staff. They work to carry out reforms, set up new projects to improve the courses and the life of students and staff, etc. Like a mini-government!</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />But the VP you’ll be most interested in is the student VP, who, as the name implies, is a student!</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />And what about year heads? Well, there aren’t any either! You’re an adult, so you can discipline yourself. The university is also a way for you to become independent! On the other hand, there are safety officers to protect students and staff.</div>

    <h3 id="lille-1-lille-2-lille-3-its-over">Lille 1, Lille 2, Lille 3, it’s over…</h3>
    <div>On 1 January 2018, the three universities in Lille – Lille 1, Lille 2, Lille 3 – merged. Today, there is just one university – the University of Lille with 67,000 students! For your future employers, it will all be a lot more simple…</div>

    <div>This is a chance to take the best ideas and skills from each of the old establishments. But please be patient: the staff are working hard to harmonise their approaches and simplify procedures. There is still a lot to do, but we’re making progress!</div>

              <p style="margin:0;">You can be proud of the fact that at the university, the teachers are also <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/home/research/">researchers</a>, and they can pass on the most up-to-date knowledge!</p>
