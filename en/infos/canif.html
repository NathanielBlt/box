You can go there without an appointment to see a nurse, get an appointment with a doctor or a gynaecologist (the pill, etc.). It’s free – you just need your <em>Carte Vitale</em> health card and your mutual health insurance card. There are several different centres and offices in Lille, Villeneuve d’Ascq and Roubaix.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Libraries</span>. The “school library” has just got much bigger. There are several general libraries, and lots of other specialised ones. <span>See <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/bibliotheques-et-learning-centers/" target="_blank">more details on this page</a></span>, and <a href="http://ubib.fr/" target="_blank"><span>ask your questions on this chat</span></a>.</div>

<div>A tip – always have your student card on you (= “CMS” card). It comes in handy for lots of things – as I.D., to borrow books from the library, to pay for meals, to keep track of your hours for sport and sometimes to access the work rooms, bike sheds, lockers, etc.</div>

It’s the number of books/documents on open shelves in the university libraries. In other words, lots of things you won’t find on the internet!</p>
