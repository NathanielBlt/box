              <h1>New services to help you!</h1>

              <h2>You just need to go and see them…</h2></div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
<div><span class="highlight">Health issues, feeling down?</span> The “school nurse” is now a <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/centre-de-sante-des-etudiants/"><span>health centre</span></a>. You can go there without an appointment to see a nurse, get an appointment with a doctor or a gynaecologist (the pill, etc.). It’s free – you just need your <em>Carte Vitale</em> health card and your mutual health insurance card. There are several different centres and offices in Lille, Villeneuve d’Ascq and Roubaix.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Libraries</span>. The “school library” has just got much bigger. There are several general libraries, and lots of other specialised ones. <span>See <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/bibliotheques-et-learning-centers/">more details on this page</a></span>, and <a href="http://ubib.fr/"><span>ask your questions on this chat</span></a>.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Choosing the right studies.</span> The “careers guidance office” at school is now the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/etudes/sinformer-sorienter/"><span>SUAIO</span></a>. Do you have a career in mind or are you desperately looking for ideas? Want to change direction? Then go ahead and contact them!</div>
<h3 id="whats-new">What’s new</h3>
<div><span class="highlight">Registration and exams</span>. For the administrative registration at the start of the academic year and for exams, there is an academic studies department. (<span class="highlight">LINK</span>)</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Erasmus and studying abroad</span>. More information from the <a href="https://international.univ-lille.fr/"><span>Direction of international mobilities</span></a>.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Associations, accommodation, transport, etc.</span> Contact the student-life and disability office. They will help you with practical problems (accommodation, transport, grant requests) and give information about setting up and running a student association.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Goodbye to P.E.</span>, hello to the sports department. At university, there’s a lot of choice – it’s free! The <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/sport/"><span>sports department</span></a> has dozens of activities on offer.</div>
<div><span class="highlight">Finding a job</span></div>
<div>After university, students find jobs in practically every field! Here, after a master’s degree, most students get a job within six months, and 80% within two years.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" /><a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/etudes/preparer-son-insertion-professionnelle/stages-et-emplois/"><span>To meet up with professionals, do internships, etc. go and see the BAIP</span></a></div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" /><a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/etudes/preparer-son-insertion-professionnelle/hubhouse/"><span>To set up a firm, work in your association, create your own job – head for the hubhouse.</span></a></div>

<h3 id="the-student-cardthe-vital-sesame">The student card: the vital sesame</h3>
<div>A tip – always have your student card on you (= “CMS” card). It comes in handy for lots of things – as I.D., to borrow books from the library, to pay for meals, to keep track of your hours for sport and sometimes to access the work rooms, bike sheds, lockers, etc.</div>

              <p class="didyouknowquestion">If we say one million, what comes to mind?</p>
              <p style="margin:0;">
It’s the number of books/documents in the university libraries. In other words, lots of things you won’t find on the internet!</p>
