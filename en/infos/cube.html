              <h1>There’s more to life than lessons!</h1>

              <h2>Time to open up to the outside world…</h2></div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
<div>At university, there are lessons, but that’s not all! You might not realise at once, but it’s during these years that you’ll become an adult. So open up to the outside world! Make the most of everything on offer: cinema (we’ve got one – the Kino!), theatre, exhibitions, concerts, etc. All through the year, our services provide a <a href="https://culture.univ-lille.fr/" target="_blank"><span>rich cultural programme</span></a>, a lot of activities – and it’s totally free! And <a href="https://sport.univ-lille.fr/" target="_blank"><span>sport</span></a> is not forgotten: a swimming pool, a gym, tennis courts, etc., there are about <span class="highlight">40 sports facilities</span> on our campuses.</div>
<h3 id="associations-for-all-tastes">Associations for all tastes </h3>
<div>Our campuses are teeming with associations! And it’s a great way to meet people and not to stay on your own! Associations by subject (linked to your studies) or theme (allotments, disabilities, art, music, etc.): you’re free to choose (or set up) the one that suits you best and that you want to get involved in!</div>
<div><a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/vie-associative-et-engagement-citoyen/"  target="_blank"><button type="button" class="popup_btn"><span class="icon-arrow-circle-o-right" />Need more details? Contact the student-life office</span></button></a></div>

<h3 id="get-elected-to-change-things">Get elected to change things</h3>
<div>Complain – or take action? To make your voice heard and defend your interests, there are elected student organisations! They meet in different assemblies where decisions are taken about your faculty, and more generally about the university (bodies called in French <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/universite/organisation/" target="_blank"><span>the CA or the CFVU</span></a>).</div>
<div>It is important for you to vote, to choose the candidates who you think will represent you best, the ones who will speak on your behalf in all these bodies and even outside them! Voting takes place every two years by proportional representation (you vote for lists).</div>
<div class="square">The <span class="highlight">student vice-president</span> represents all the students. Her name is Imane Echaabi. She is on hand to help you, answer any questions you might have or discuss any issues you face. <a href="mailto:imane.echaabi@univ-lille.fr"  target="_blank">Feel free to contact her.</a></div>

          <div><a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/vie-associative-et-engagement-citoyen/engagement-etudiant/"  target="_blank"><button type="button" class="popup_btn"><span class="icon-arrow-circle-o-right" />More information about student elected officials</span></button></a></div>
<div>In short, <span class="highlight">take action!</span> Enjoy an enriching personal and human experience in favour of active citizenship and solidarity! What’s more, you can have <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/etudes/amenagements-des-etudes/" target="_blank"><span>specially adapted studies…</span></a></div>
