              <h2>A few travel tips!</h2></div>

      <div class="content">

<div><span class="icon-location" />Lille has an international <a href="https://www.lille.aeroport.fr/" target="_blank"><span>airport</span></a> and several train stations with services to the rest of France and other countries (Belgium, Holland, Germany, the UK, etc.).</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Lille also has excellent links to the rest of the Hauts-de-France region <a href="https://cdn.ter.sncf.com/medias/PDF/hauts_de_france/11%20620%20Le%20reseau%20Ter%20Hauts%20de%20France%2014%20juin%202017_tcm77-160983_tcm77-160752.pdf" target="_blank"><span>via the TER train network</span></a>. Most of the time, you can take <a href="https://www.ter.sncf.com/hauts-de-france/gares/ter-intermodalite/combinez-vos-deplacements/train-et-velo" target="_blank"><span>your bike</span></a> on trains.</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Each campus at the University of Lille is accessible by metro and bus. There is a map of metro and bus stops and nearby bike stations on the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/transport/" target="_blank"><span>“Transport” page of the university website</span></a>. On <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.61116/3.14192" target="_blank">Cité Scientifique Campus</a>, there is a Bike House (a community-based bicycle repair) (<a href="https:www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/des-lieux-de-vie-et-detudes/" target="_blank">video</a>, <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/universite/campus-durables/" target="_blank">contact</a>). If you don’t have your own bike, there is a bike-sharing network, <a href="https://www.transpole.fr/cms/institutionnel/fr/reseau-transpole/velo-libre-service-vls/" target="_blank"><span>V’lille</span></a>.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />There is a single travelcard for the TER train, metro, bus, tramway and V’lille: the <a href="http://www.lillemetropole.fr/mel/institution/competences/transports-mobilite/carte-pass-pass.html" target="_blank"><span>Pass-Pass card</span></a>.</div>

<div>So don’t hesitate to move around the different campuses for a meal, an exhibition, to borrow books, go to a lesson, walk in the parks, etc. – <span class="highlight">this is your university</span>, so make the most of it!</div>

<h3 id="environmentally-friendly-transport">Environmentally friendly transport</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />So you’ll see that we much prefer our students and staff to get around on foot, by bike and by public transport. After all, there are over 70,000 of us – if we all travel by car, imagine the impact on our lungs and on the health of all the local population (not to mention on global warming).</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />But if you really can’t do otherwise, several University of Lille sites have car parks that are accessible to students. <span class="icon-issue-opened" />Please note, they have a limited capacity.</div>

<h3 id="useful-information">Useful information:</h3>
<div>Here are a few <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/transport/" target="_blank"><span>journey times</span></a> to different sites at the university, as well as a map of the bus stops and bike stations nearby.</div>

              <p class="didyouknowquestion">If we say 8, what comes to mind?</p>
              <p style="margin:0;">This is the number of towns where the University of Lille is located. Most of them are in the metropolitan area, but there are also two others – Cambrai and Wimereux on the Opal Coast!</p>
