<h3 id="how-to-go-on-to-the-next-year">How to go on to the next year</h3>
<div>Your year is divided into two terms or <span class="highlight">semesters</span>.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />To pass an academic year (for “licence générale”), you need to have an average mark of 10 or more in your "BCC"</div>
<p class="icon-arrow-right"><span class="highlight">BCC what?</span> In order to build bridges between curricula, and to open university to people of every age, your subject is organized into blocks (bloc de connaissances et de compétences − BCC), each corresponding to a goal.</p>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" /><span class="highlight">CU? UE?</span> A course unit (CU) (<em>UE</em> in French) is a group of subjects (with lectures, tutorials, lab work), or a project, internship, dissertation, etc. You have about ten each term. One BCC = one or several UE.</div>
<p class="icon-attention">There isn’t a system of compensation between semesters.</p>
<!--<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Otherwise, in exceptional situations, you can do a “crossover”: the following year, you take the CUs in the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, while completing the CUs from the 1<sup>st</sup> year.</div>-->


<h3 id="options-to-choose-from-and-special-cus">Build your career plan</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />In each term, there is a core course for all students, but also lessons to choose from, helping you to specialise through your choice of particular subjects.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Thinking about your career plan? You can precise it with option courses! See course unit Projet de l'étudiant (UE PE) <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/etudes/construire-son-projet-personnel-et-professionnel/" target="_blank">here!</a></span></div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Often, what you do during your personal and professional project, such as your activities in associations, in the arts, sport, overseas and special CUs, can all count: get more information from your course advisors.</div>

<h3 id="what-is-an-academic-unit">What is an academic unit?</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />An academic unit (<em>composante</em> in French) is the place where the various courses in your subject (bachelor’s, master’s degrees, etc.) are managed: the timetable, options, etc. This is where the administration in charge of your course is often located, the <span class="highlight">student affairs office</span>.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />The academic units, the education and research centres (UFR) and the faculties are the same thing. Sometimes, they have sub-divisions (departments). The name of your unit is given in the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/formations.html" target="_blank"><span>course file</span></a>, in the “Contacts” tab.</div>

              <p class="didyouknowquestion">What’s the deal with credits?</p>
              <p style="margin:0;">To complete a term, you need 30 credits – so, 60 for a year and 180 for the whole degree. Credits – also known as ECTS – are an equivalent grade you can use to study in other universities in Europe (Erasmus, etc.).</p>
