<div>The university is a big place and sometimes you may feel lonely. You need to be self-sufficient, make ends meet, and it’s not always easy. So if you have a worry, this is where you can go for help:</div>
<div class="square">
<h3 id="a-medical-emergency-on-the-campus">A medical emergency on the campus? </h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Don’t waste a second, dial 15. The emergency services are trained to react fast.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />There is sometimes an emergency unit on the campuses: call them on 03 20 41 64 40 (Pont-de-Bois) and 03 20 43 44 44 (Cité scientifique). Ask at your academic secretariat or department/faculty (on other sites).</div>
</div>
<h3 id="feeling-alone-do-you-have-health-issues">Feeling alone? Do you have health issues?</h3>
<div>A medical, gynaecological, psychological, nutritional or social question or problem? Need a consultation, a medical certificate, a preventive check-up, a booster for a vaccination, etc.?</div>

<div><span class="icon-location" />Go to the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/centre-de-sante-des-etudiants/" target="_blank"><span>students’ health centre</span></a>. There is a centre on five sites, with a single number: 03 62 26 93 00. You pay nothing upfront, you just need to show your up-to-date <em>Carte Vitale</em> health card (or certificate) and proof of health insurance, if you have one.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />In conflict with your parents or issues with your partner? Contact the <a href="https://www.crous-lille.fr/action-sociale/rencontrer-une-mediatrice-familiale/" target="_blank"><span>mediator</span></a> from the Crous.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />You can contact the <a href="https://bapulille.com/" target="_blank"><span>university psychological assistance office</span></a> (03 20 54 85 26), the psychiatric help centre on 03 20 78 22 22 (<span class="highlight">24 hours a day</span>).</div>

<div><span class="icon-issue-opened" />Please do the same if you see someone who looks like they need help or seems really down. A university is like a town; we need everyone to be a little bit attentive to the others.</div>
<h3 id="money-worries">Money worries? </h3>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Please don’t hesitate to meet one of the social workers. They <a href="https://www.crous-lille.fr/action-sociale/rencontrer-assistante-sociale/" target="_blank"><span>are on duty</span></a> in Lille, Villeneuve d’Ascq and Roubaix.</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Discounted products are available in two solidarity grocery stores on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lacampusserie/" target="_blank">Pont-de-Bois</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EPISCEA" target="_blank">Health</a> Campus (open in October).</div>
