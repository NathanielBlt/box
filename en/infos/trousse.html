      <div class="content">
<div>The university is a big place and sometimes you may feel lonely. You need to be self-sufficient, make ends meet, and it’s not always easy. So if you have a worry, this is where you can go for help:</div>
<div class="square">
<h3 id="a-medical-emergency-on-the-campus">A medical emergency on the campus? </h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Don’t waste a second, dial 15. The emergency services are trained to react fast.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />There is sometimes an emergency unit on the campuses: call them on 03 20 41 64 40 (Pont-de-Bois) and 03 20 43 44 44 (Cité scientifique). Ask your faculty for the phone number on other sites.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="feeling-alone-do-you-have-health-issues">Feeling alone? Do you have health issues?</h3>
<div>A medical, gynaecological, psychological, nutritional or social question or problem? Need a consultation, a medical certificate, a preventive check-up, a booster for a vaccination, etc.?</div>

<div><span class="icon-location" />Go to the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/vie-des-campus/centre-de-sante-des-etudiants/"><span>students’ health centre</span></a>. There is a centre on five sites, with a single number: 03 20 90 74 05. You pay nothing upfront, you just need to show your up-to-date <em>Carte Vitale</em> health card (or certificate) and proof of health insurance, if you have one.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />In conflict with your parents or issues with your partner? Contact the <a href="https://www.crous-lille.fr/action-sociale/rencontrer-une-mediatrice-familiale/"><span>mediator</span></a> from the Crous.</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />You can contact the <a href="https://bapulille.com/"><span>university psychological assistance office</span></a> (03 20 54 85 26), the psychiatric help centre on 03 20 78 22 22 (<span class="highlight">24 hours a day</span>).</div>

<div><span class="icon-issue-opened" />Please do the same if you see someone who looks like they need help or seems really down. A university is like a town; we need everyone to be a little bit attentive to the others.</div>
<h3 id="money-worries">Money worries? </h3>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Please don’t hesitate to meet one of the social workers. They <a href="https://www.crous-lille.fr/action-sociale/rencontrer-une-assistance-sociale/"><span>are on duty</span></a> in Lille, Villeneuve d’Ascq and Roubaix.</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />Discounted products are available in two solidarity grocery stores on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lacampusserie/">Pont-de-Bois</a> and <a href="https://business.facebook.com/EPISCEA/">Health</a> Campus (open in October).</div>
<div><span class="icon-location" />And for tips and practical information, feel free to visit the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/universite/campus-solidaires-et-engages/"><span>student-life office</span></a>!</div>
<h3 id="harassment-discrimination-conflict">Harassment, discrimination, conflict?</h3>
<div>The University of Lille is committed to combating all forms of violence and discrimination, and for equality between men and women..</div>

<div><span class="icon-location" />If you have a problem or if you are upset by something, you can contact the <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/universite/organisation/"><span>mediation centre</span></a> by e-mail, telephone or in person (at the university headquarters or when they are on duty in most of the campuses). They can listen to you and guide you: the university has units to combat sexual harassment and bullying, and a mediator/contact for racism and antisemitism. .</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />All these structures are committed to work in complete neutrality, impartiality and confidentiality.</div>
