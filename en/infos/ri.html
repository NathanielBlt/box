    <p>Well, we might as well tell you at once – your adventures with the formalities of the French administration will not necessarily be a restful experience. But don’t worry, there are people on hand to help! Go to the <a href="https://osm.org/go/0B1fy5XVR?m=" target="_blank"><span class="icon-location"></span>maison internationale</a> with activities all along the year!

    <h3 id="le-titre-de-séjour">Coming to Lille</h3>

    <p><a href="https://international.univ-lille.fr/en/come-to-study-at-the-university/on-an-individual-basis/"   target="_blank">Here’s all the info you need!</a></p>
    <h3 id="residence-permit">Residence permit</h3>
    <div><span class="highlight">Before you arrive</span>. Are you in France to study for longer than three months (and you are not from the European Union/Switzerland/Norway/Iceland)? You’ll need a permit: generally, this is the “<span><a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/R52684" target="_blank">long-stay visa for students</a>”</span>.</div>
    <div><span class="highlight">How to get it.</span> For some countries, you have to follow a simplified procedure online (“<a href="https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/procedure-etudes-en-France" target="_blank"><span>Studying in France</span></a>”). Otherwise, contact the French consulate in your own country.</div>
<div>Get your visa stamped when you arrive: you have three months to carry out this simple and quick procedure via the following website: <a href="https://administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr</a>. This guarantees you authorised residency in France to complete your academic year. You will <a href="https://timbres.impots.gouv.fr/"  target="_blank">have to pay €60</a> and will need an email address, a postal address in France and a bank card.
      </div>
      <div><span class="highlight">After your first year in France</span>, you will have to renew your visa to obtain a residency permit. You will have to provide quite a few documents … and have them <span class="highlight">translated into French</span> (this is generally cheaper if you have it done at the registry office in your own country). <span class="icon-issue-opened" />Please note that you need to prove you have enough income (at least €615 a month).</div>
    <div class="square"><span class="highlight">Who should I contact?</span> There is a department at the university that is used to all this, so you won’t need to do everything yourself. <a href="mailto:titredesejour@univ-lille.fr" target="_blank">Feel free to get in touch!</a>.</div>
    <h3 id="help-with-the-rent">Help with the rent</h3>
    <div>You can have housing benefit to help pay the rent, called “personal accommodation benefit” (<em><span class="highlight">APL</span></em> in French). But you need to apply as soon as possible because it takes a long time to process applications. You should contact a body called the <a href="https://osm.org/go/0EgIojJ~C?m=" target="_blank"><span class="icon-location"></span></a> <a href="https://www.caf.fr" target="_blank">CAF</a>, and provide several documents (proof you are a student, proof of social security, birth certificate, etc.)</div>
    <h3 id="opening-a-bank-account">Opening a bank account</h3>
    <div>To receive housing benefit or get a mobile phone contract, you need a bank account: to open one, you have to provide proof that you are a student and proof of residence. Please note: ESN Lille has a partnership with the <a href="http://www.esnlille.fr/satellite/fr/partners/bnp-paribas" target="_blank"><span>BNP Paribas</span></a> bank, giving students a range of benefits.</div>
    <h3 id="health-costs">Health costs</h3>
    <div>In France, the state takes care of a large share of your health costs: it’s called health care insurance. But you’ll need to sign up beforehand: <a href="https://www.ameli.fr/lille-douai/assure/droits-demarches/etudes-emploi-retraite/etudes-stages/etudiant" target="_blank"><span>everything is explained here</span></a> (in French and English).</div>
<div class="square"><span class="icon-link" /><span class="highlight">For all your administrative procedures (CAF, health insurance, etc.), be sure to register on our <a href="https://livin-france.com/school/UnivLille" target="_blank">Livin France platform</a>, which is free of charge and will ensure you adequately prepare for your arrival in Lille! </div>
