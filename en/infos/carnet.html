<div>The career-guidance staff provide:</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />individual interviews and made-to-measure information</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />orientation and project-support workshops</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />group-work sessions</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />a documentation area</div>

<h3 id="help-ive-made-a-mistake">Help, I’ve made a mistake!</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />You’ve just started your first year, but after the first few lessons, you can see it’s not going to work out… Then you need to act fast and contact the SUAIO. The staff will tell you what you can do, depending on your course and your project (possibility to change subjects at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> term: start of the procedure in <span class="highlight">November</span>)</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />But remember, reorientation is not automatic… We know it’s tempting just to pull the covers over your head, but don’t give up! If your reorientation is not accepted, you will need to start again from scratch the following year. So continue to work and you can get some credits, so you won’t have to take them again in your new course.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" /><span class="highlight">Between mid-January and mid-March</span>, you can make a new choice on the Parcoursup platform</div>

<div class="square"><span class="icon-issue-opened" />A tip: take part in the “SUAIO workshops” to help think about and develop a new educational project.</div>
