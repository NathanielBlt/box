              <h1>What? Exams?</h1>

              <h2>At university, you take exams - but not everyone!</h2></div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
<h3 id="exams-or-continuous-assessment">Exams or continuous assessment?</h3>
<div>How can you know if you can go on to the next year? It depends, either your marks from the whole year are taken into account (this is called “<em>continuous assessment</em>”) or you take exams, or there is a combination of both. To find out in your own case, ask your teachers.</div>
<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
<div>Each year, you need to register several times:</div>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />at the university, at the start of the academic year (the “<em>administrative”</em> inscription (IA in French): for more information, contact your <a href="https://www.univ-lille.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/docs__pdf__autre_/Formation/Inscription/Contacts-Scolarite%CC%81_Ulille_pour_site.pdf" target="_blank"><span>academic studies department</span></a>)</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />for lessons, tutorial groups, etc. each term (“<em>academic</em>” registration or “IP” in French, <span class="highlight">in your faculty</span>): it's important!</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" /><span class="highlight">for exams</span>: in some subjects, you need to register for exams each term</div>

<h3 id="and-when-do-i-register">Exam periods</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />For the exams, there is generally one exam session each term, in January and May. And if you don’t get the average pass mark, you have a second chance at a “2<sup>nd</sup> exam session” (or “resit”), often in June for the two terms (in September for certain subjects).</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />The exam periods are given on the university timetable. The exact dates are announced 15 days beforehand in the campuses.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Please note, finding exam dates for 67,000 students is a real headache. So don’t be surprised if sometimes you have an exam on a Saturday or at less convenient times…</div>

<div class="square">
<div><span class="icon-issue-opened" />There’s no need to make elaborate calculations – working regularly and in all your subjects is the only way to pass your exams…</div>
<div><span class="icon-attention" />As for cheating – don’t take the risk, you’re not at school anymore. Cheating is an offence and leads to heavy penalties. This sometimes includes definitive expulsion from all the universities and schools…</div>
