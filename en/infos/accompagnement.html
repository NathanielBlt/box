              <h1>Need help for your studies?</h1>

              <h2>For a top-up, help is at hand! So you might as well use it.</h2></div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
    <div>Let’s not kid ourselves – at university, some are more equal than others. They more or less know how it all works and set off with a bit of a head start.</div>
    <div>So, to help compensate, the university and the public authorities have set up support measures adapted to your courses: mentoring, tutoring, refresher courses, individual support, work on spelling…</div>
    <div>PRREL – who’s it for and why?</div>

    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />This was a scheme set up by the region and aimed first of all at grant holders, as well as students with a vocational or technical baccalaureate, and for students with lower pass-marks at the baccalaureate.</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />This measure is included in the “yes-if” option on Parcoursup. But it can also be suggested by your course leader at the start of the academic year to help you make progress.</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />It includes mentoring sessions, complementary elements designed by teachers, and a follow-up with an academic advisor for your project, for your options, for the direction you give to your education.</div>

    <div>Made-to-measure orientation</div>
    <div>Since the start of this year, made-to-measure courses that are better adapted to student diversity have been on offered from academic advisors – the “educational success contract”. It can extend bachelor’s degrees into a fourth year or may be a different way to teach certain lessons. But whatever happens, it’s the same degree and the same qualification at the end!</div>
    <div>What is mentoring?</div>
    <div>The idea is that students with a more advanced level (the tutors) work with you in small groups or individually, giving you tips about working methods, extra details about a particular point of a lesson and moral support to help you persevere…</div>
    <div>Who can help you with your studies?</div>

    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />In most of the bachelor’s degree courses and technology degrees, you can regularly meet a teacher to see how things are going and get support, find ways to help you adapt and use the right methods…</div>


    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />You can also contact the health department, where there is stress-support on offer, with tips to take good care of yourself and stay in shape.</div>
    <div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />And don’t forget the student associations (students’ union, associations).</div>
