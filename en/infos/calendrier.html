              <h1>A quick look at the year…</h1>

              <h2>Here’s where we explain your timetable.</h2></div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
<div>To download the university timetable, see below:</div>
<div>If your course takes place mainly in:</div>

<div><span class="icon-paperclip" />Pont-de-Bois -&gt; link</div>
<div><span class="icon-paperclip" />Cité scientifique - &gt; link</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Elsewhere: see your faculty for details</div>

<div>Please note, this is only a general timetable for all the university. It’s your faculty (the “student-affairs office”) that will give you detailed information about your timetable.</div>
<h3 id="at-university-there-are-two-semesters">At university, there are two semesters</h3>

<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />The academic year is divided into two terms or semesters. The first runs from September to December, and the second from January to June. (courses: about 12 to 15 weeks in each term.)</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />For bachelor’s degrees, the semesters are numbered. S1 is the 1<sup>st</sup> semester of the 1<sup>st</sup> year and S2 is the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester; S3 is the 1<sup>st</sup> semester of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, and so on, until the last one, S6.</div>
<div><span class="icon-arrow-right" />Sometimes people refer to odd-numbered semesters (S1, S3, S5 – the terms in the first half of the academic year) and even-numbered semesters (S2, S4, S6).</div>

<div>The exception is in the first core year of health studies (Paces), where there are three terms.</div>

<h3 id="assessments-sessions-exams-explained">“Assessments”, “sessions”: exams explained</h3>
<div><a onclick="$('#ctnContentModal').load('infos/examens.html');" target="_blank">Everything is explained here.</a></div>
<div class="square">
<h3 id="course-break-holidays">Course break ≠ holidays</h3>
<div>Watch out for a misunderstanding: at some periods you don’t have lessons. However, these are not holidays, but “course breaks”. Roughly speaking, this means that you have times when you can relax, but also revise for exams, work on a project, catch up on missed lessons, etc.</div>
<div>A tip: don’t book your plane tickets – but wait for your faculty to give details about how exactly the course breaks are organised.</div></div>

          <div>
              <p class="didyouknowquestion">Anyway, setting up the university timetable can’t be very complicated, can it?</p>
              <p style="margin:0;">Well, actually, it takes weeks! Because everyone is concerned, and if you move one date by just a day or two, there are a whole series of repercussions on other things at other periods of the year…</p>
